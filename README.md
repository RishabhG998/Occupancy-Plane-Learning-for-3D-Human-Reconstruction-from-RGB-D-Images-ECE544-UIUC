# Occupancy-Plane-Learning-for-3D-Human-Reconstruction-from-RGB-D-Images-ECE544-UIUC
Reconstruction of shapes is an interesting research area and it has wide applications
across domains such as robotics, medical imaging, fashion etc. Over the years,
there have been several advanced techniques that have been discovered for 3D
reconstruction. In this paper, we will discuss a method for reconstruction of human
images, where occupancy planes are used to slice a given 2D RGB image. We
consider a range of depth values in front of the camera over which the occupancy
plane slices the image and the output indicates the presence of human at that depth.
We closely follow the work by Zhao et al. [1] to generate occupancy planes though
we do not continue to full 3D reconsutrction.
